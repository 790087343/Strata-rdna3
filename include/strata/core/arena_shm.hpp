// include/strata/core/arena_shm.hpp - [claude] STRATA_ARENA_SHM: the expert arena kept in shared memory across engine starts.
//
// A benchmark run restarts the engine, and ~25 s of every start is reading the same 47 GiB of experts from the SSD into an
// anonymous arena that dies with the process.  STRATA_ARENA_SHM=<name> backs the arena with a shared-memory object instead
// (a /dev/shm file, or a memfd held by a `sleep infinity` keeper when /dev/shm cannot hold it) that outlives the engine; the
// next start whose key matches maps it AS its arena (MAP_SHARED: no copy, RAM is not counted twice) and skips the read.
//
// The object's name carries a 64-bit key of everything the arena's bytes depend on (the pack's metadata and sampled content,
// every source file's path, size, mtime and inode, the arena geometry and a layout version), and its 2 MiB header repeats the
// key, the size and a "complete" state that is written only after a full, successful load.  Any mismatch - another pack or
// quant, a file touched since, a load that died half way - is never mapped: the start loads normally (and an unused stale
// object of the same <name> is deleted, so its RAM comes back).  The caller also compares a few sampled experts against the
// source files after attaching (ArenaExpertSource).
//
// Locking (flock on the object): a creator holds LOCK_EX while it fills the arena, every engine using it holds LOCK_SH for
// its lifetime, and only an object nobody holds can be deleted or rebuilt.  Linux only; elsewhere open() says no.
